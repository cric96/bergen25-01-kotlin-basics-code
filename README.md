# Kotlin for Compose
   
   ## A collection of examples to understand the basics of Kotlin for Jetpack Compose
   
   This repository is the companion to the presentation about [Kotlin primer](https://github.com/cric96/bergen25-01-kotlin-basics). 
   It contains examples to help you understand the fundamental components of Kotlin that are particularly relevant for Jetpack Compose development.
   
   The project is organized into two main packages:
   
   - **it.unibo.basics**: Contains all the basic concepts of Kotlin that extend Java definitions
     - Classes, functions, inheritance, properties, etc.
     
   - **it.unibo.compose**: Contains Kotlin concepts essential for Jetpack Compose
     - Delegation, lambdas, extension functions/properties, data classes
   
   Each file contains detailed examples with comments to illustrate how these features work and how they're used in Compose development.
